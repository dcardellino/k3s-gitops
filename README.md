## ðŸ“– Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## â›µ Kubernetes

There's an excellent template over at [k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal Ubuntu 20.04 using the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s). This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage. I also use my Synology NAS with the [Synology CSI](https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/synology-csi), which provisions iSCSI Volumes to some of my deployments.

ðŸ”¸ _[Click here](./ansible/) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components

- [mozilla/sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Manages secrets for Kubernetes
- [kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [jetstack/cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [cloudflare/cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Provides a secure network tunnel to expose some of my services to the internet.
- [kubernetes-sigs/external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [cluster](./cluster/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

The Git repository contains the following directories under [cluster](./cluster/) and are ordered below by how [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) will apply them.

- **base**: directory is the entrypoint to [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
- **crds**: directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists.
- **core**: directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
- **apps**: directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore.
